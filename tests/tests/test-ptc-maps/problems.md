  MAD-X:

- KNL[1] and ksl[1] are never communicated to PTC (for bend reasons?)
- If solenoid strength is zero, PTC ignores it and therefore knl and ksl are not communicated to PTC
- In a quadrupole, MAD-X removes any input of knl[2] and ksl[2]
- MAD-X does not communicate tilt in ELSEPARATOR to PTC
- MAD-X does not allow to turn off fringe in RBEND
- MAD-X defines a k0 for the crab cavity based on volt
- MAD-X does not support totalpath in RFMULTIPOLE
- MAD-X does not support totalpath in CRABCAVITY
  
  Other:

- MAD-NG does not support the same syntax for the rf cavity as MAD-X for totalpath
- MAD-NG does not support the same syntax for the elseparator as MAD-X for exl and eyl

What needs to be tested for MAD-NG vs MAD-NG:
- General
  - tilt + skew
  - backtracking
  - multipole part vs non multipole part
  - lots of dkd -> tkt
  - negation

- Multipole  
  - Multiple at same point with ksi, ksl, knl seperately and together
