Version 0.9.6 [12/12/2022]:
- new python interface (Thanks to Joshua Mark Gray)
- non-linear parametric normal form with ANH, GNF and HAM extraction.
- new MADX sequence parser (solve problems with FCC-ee Booster and other R&D lattices)
- few speed improvements including parallelisation with OMP.
- complete review and extensions of many modules including linear algebra (see manual part IV)
- many extension to GTPSA and DAMAP modules (e.g. some Lie Algebra operators)
- support for compatible DAMAP with PTC I/O (including (pt,-t) handling inside GTPSA)
- radiation and photon tracking
- new manual format using Sphinx to generate PDF and HTML (with search engine)
- manual part IV added, except ongoing differential algebra manual (coming soon).
- many bug fixes

Version 0.9.5 [07/04/2021]:
- fix typo in beam cloning in track.
- add support for poisson bracket direction in gtpsa conversion.
  allow to (re)move and permute canonical variables in damap.
- add option.ptcorder to write/dump gtpsa in the PTC order, i.e. (pt,-t)
- improve read method for gtpsa, allow to detect/force the type to read.
  better error handling (not stopping), return name of gtpsa or error string.
- improve write method for gtpsa and damap
- add read method for damap (was NYI)

Version 0.9.4 [08/03/2021]:
- improve foreach selector of sequences and mtable.
- fix delegation of binary operator right side for Complex, Matrix and GTPSA.
- add pc column to track table for energy patches.
- implementation of energy patches.
- fix yrotation sign (in parallel to MAD-X fix).
- fix phi sign in survey table.
- dispersion using finite difference, active with chrom for comparison.
- dispersion in 6D from E. Forest's method.
- thick sub-elements are allowed.

Version 0.9.3 [12/01/2021]:
- fix synchrotron radiation 1-5, new synch_6 and synch_8 added.
- fix phase advance and synch. radiation for backtracking (time reversal).
- fix integer part of q3.
- added support for used-defined knobs. All maps and commands accept
  user-defined knobs now (a unique feature?) to compute parametric one-turn-map.
- match command supports user-defined jacobian, allows to use derivatives vs
  knobs as a replacement of costly finite difference approximations, saving
  N track or twiss run per iteration for N variables.
- damaps can extract/fill matrices from tables of monomials useful to compute
  jocobian in match command.
- fix some issues in GTPSA module and library to support user-defined knobs.
- radiation is now handled by twiss and cofind.
- twiss and cofind use nocopy qualifier, saving one pass of track in twiss.
- twiss handle automatically closed orbit search, cofind attribute removed to
  avoid confusion between user initial setup and cofind attribute.
- track extended to search for the reference closed orbit O0 with initial guess
  and express X0 coordinates around it.
- small fix with unexpected side effects from e1 and e2.
- small fix in photon tracking [experimental]
- new solenoid soft edge fringe field for FCC-ee [experimental]
- new non linear elliptic lenses element [experimental]
- new beam beam element 4D [experimental]
- add solenoid kick to multipole (thin) map for compatibility between DKD and
  TKT integration models and slicing.
- new alternate object model copy on creation (closer to MAD-X). This object
  model is less flexible, slower on object creation but faster on lookup (track).
- invert modules dependency between physics and objects (concern 12 modules) for
  future support of alternate object model. Sensitive in dynamic language...
- new beta0 object added, some physics will be moved from gphys module to this
  object in the next release as a consequence of the module dependency inversion.
  It can be used to prevent closed orbit search from coordinates in twiss,
  setting default beta functions to 1m (MAD-X like).
- fix delegation of binary operator right side for Complex, Matrix and GTPSA.
- libmadx to run MAD-X from MAD-NG (cpymad-like interface to MAD-X), unfinished.

Version 0.9.2 [30/10/2020]:
- remove clearing at and from after installation to follow general policy to not
  modify user elements.
- add used-defined comparison to method install (and insert_sat) to handle left
  or right insertion of element and sub-element, add operators as strings.
- added element methods insert_sat, replace_sat, remove_sat to thick_element and
  drift_element.
- improve sequence foreach to run through sub-elements with subelem selector.
- improve sequence filter to return index of sub-elements encoded as midx.sat.
- improve sequence install to handle elements colliding with existing elements,
  solved automatically by installing them at relative sub-element positions.
- improve sequence remove to remove sub-elements as for normal element.
- improve sequence replace to replace sub-elements as for normal element.
- add mtable rencol to rename a column, useful to transform content of an
  "expected" column using column generator.
- unify cmp in bsearch, lsearch, elm:index_sat, and seq:install with sorting.
- fix problem to write damap in files.
- add slink element, useful for recirculator or energy recovery linac.
- add reference orbit in track, cofind and twiss.
- move aperture check to last slice instead slice 0 for better element name.
- allow for mtable rows proxy to be provided directly as X0 or O0 in track,
  cofind and twiss.
- add synchrotron radiations: false, true, average, quantum[+photon].
- changenrj reset pt, move to beam, clone beam for each particle if needed.
- add tracking of photons (todo: fix pb with nan in sbend due to zero charge)
- add minlen to sequence to set minimum drift length (for compat. with MAD-X)

Version 0.9.1 [13/10/2020]:
- fix a problem when sequences are built from subsequences defined in separate
  files (e.g. PS).
- sequence install let the user to install elements before or after equal
  s-position.
- fix phase advance for backtracking and the integer part of mu3.
- a lot of cleanup and unification to synchronise the code with the manual.
- manual is now 181 p., Part I is almost complete but the manual is still far
  incomplete (contains ~20%).
- examples added for FODO, PS, LHC, HL-LHC, CLIC, FCC-ee.

Version 0.9.0 [10/08/2020]:
- first beta3 release.
- draft version of Part I and II of the manual.
- changes vs beta2 is too long

Version 0.8.0 [14/11/2019]:
- first beta2 release.
- changes vs beta1 is too long, no manual yet.
